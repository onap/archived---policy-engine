PAP (Policy Administration Point)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Accessing and Starting PAP
--------------------------

- To access the PAP docker use 

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker exec -it -u 0 pap su - policy

- All Policy related software are installed under the policy account, the policy root directory is under *${POLICY_HOME}* environment variable and it may be changed on a per installation basis. It is typically set up under the */opt/app/policy* directory but can be changed during installation. All Policy software runs with non-root privileges as *policy* is a regular user account. 

- Once within the PAP Container the running status can be checked using the following policy status command.

    .. code-block:: bash

        policy [--debug] status|start|stop

- To get the current status of Policy use *policy.sh status*

    .. code-block:: bash

        policy@pap:~$ policy.sh status
            pap: UP: running with pid 2114
            console: UP: running with pid 2135
            paplp: UP: running with pid 2155
            3 cron jobs installed.

- To Stop the components use *policy.sh stop*

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        policy@pap:~$ policy.sh stop
            paplp: STOPPING ..
            console: STOPPING ..
            pap: STOPPING ..

- To Start use *policy.sh start* 

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        policy@pap:~$ policy.sh start
            pap: STARTING ..
            console: STARTING ..
            paplp: STARTING ..

Healthcheck
-----------

- To perform Health check on policy components you can follow the generic procedure documented as below. 

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        # Assuming the healthcheck service credentials have not been changed
        # post-installation within the drools container
    
        source /opt/policy/config/drools/feature-healthcheck.conf
    
        curl --silent --user "${HEALTHCHECK_USER}:${HEALTHCHECK_PASSWORD}" 
                       -X GET http://localhost:6969/healthcheck | python -m json.tool

- Additional information can be found in the documentation for Testing, Deploying, and debugging on a PDP-D Healthcheck. 

Logs
----

- Logs for PAP are located at *$POLICY_HOME/servers/pap/logs/* location. The main application logs can be found at *$POLICY_HOME/servers/pap/logs/Policy/ONAP-PAP-REST* location. 
- Policy PAP uses EELF logging framework for logging and if needed to be modified can be modified at *$POLICY_HOME/servers/pap/webapps/pap/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml*. This change needs a restart of the PAP component in order to be in effect. 
- The Logs are divided into separate files and debug logs can be found in *debug.log* and error logs in *error.log* file which are two different files under application logs directory. 

PDP (Policy Decision Point)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Accessing and Starting PDP
--------------------------

- To access the PDP docker : 

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker exec -it -u 0 pdp su - policy

- To start and stop the PDP components the same procedure can be followed as documented for PAP. 

    .. code-block:: bash

        policy [--debug] status|start|stop

Healthcheck / Testing
---------------------

- The Policy PDP health check can be checked using the generic procedure documented above for PAP which applies to all policy components. 
- Apart from the above check PDP also provides the swagger UI from which PDP REST APIs which can be tested and used, this also lets us know the PDP Status. In order to access PDP's swagger UI visit http://{PDP_URL}:8081/pdp/swagger-ui.html 
- In order to test the Policy components, the swagger UI provided by PDP can be used to test PDP and PAP.
