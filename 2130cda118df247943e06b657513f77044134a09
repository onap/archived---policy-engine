You could just do here:  \n\nif (uniqueDataKeySplit.length \u003c 2) continue;\n\nto go to next key and get around this problem.   \n\nAnother caveat is that is the string has multiple \"%\" the split will give you back and array with more than 2 entries, not sure what\u0027s the input data, but you could limit it to only one split with split(\"%\", 2).",
