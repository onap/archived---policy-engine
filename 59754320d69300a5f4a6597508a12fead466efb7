      "message": "This is not functional code for the application, it is an exmample we give to clients as a starting point to help setup their own client or test.  Here if isEdit is false then we call createPolicy() and if isEdit is true then we call updatePolicy().  So this change will do nothing.  isEdit is set at the top before the main() to either false or true depending on what you want to do.  Most clients probably take this and create separate classes for create and update but like I said its an example we give to them.",

      "message": "I see, isEdit is hardcoded above, therefore the else would have never been hit as it was in Srinivas original submission.   \n\nMike, what Srinivas is trying to do is to clean the base as this is very likely reported by sonar (as probably as well as System.out in lines 81-85), so I think is better to change this to reduce code debt.\n\nI think to correct this can do something like:\n\nstatic Boolean isEdit \u003d new Random().nextBoolean();\n\nand leave the code as is, with that change, both the if and else statements will be reachable (as it was before the else was dead code and surely sonar would flag it)",
