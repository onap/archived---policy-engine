I think for pdp-d we have like this, for any other installation that is not ONAP, it will install under $POLICY_HOME (which is kind of nice, keeping all together, without needing any root privileges).\n\nThe important thing that drives the ONAP installation, is the docker repo project, so that base.conf is the one that needs to be modified for onap installs.",
