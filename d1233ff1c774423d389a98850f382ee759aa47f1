      "message": "Not sure about the \"upgrade\", haven\u0027t seen much of it before in Docker images.\n\nIn any case, I think mariadb-client is a package that should be in \"policy-common-alpine\" or \"policy-base-alpine\" for all images.   All of them use mariadb, and I think it would be beneficial to include the client in all of them.\n\nI just put together some thoughts about structuring the software in your ticket INT-995.   I think it would be benefitial to have all this base software snapshotted in an official release, so applications would be immune of any changes underneath in a development release.",
