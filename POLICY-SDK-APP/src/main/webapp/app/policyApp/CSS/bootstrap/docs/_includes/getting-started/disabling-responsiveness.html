  <h1 id="disable-responsive" class="page-header">Disabling responsiveness</h1>

  <p class="lead">Bootstrap automatically adapts your pages for various screen sizes.
    Here's how to disable this feature so your page works like <a href="../examples/non-responsive/">this non-responsive example</a>.</p>

  <h2>Steps to disable page responsiveness</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Omit the viewport <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> mentioned in <a href="../css/#overview-mobile">the CSS docs</a></li>
    <li>Override the <code>width</code> on the <code>.container</code> for each grid tier with a single width, for example <code>width: 970px !important;</code> Be sure that this comes after the default Bootstrap CSS. You can optionally avoid the <code>!important</code> with media queries or some selector-fu.</li>
    <li>If using navbars, remove all navbar collapsing and expanding behavior.</li>
    <li>For grid layouts, use <code>.col-xs-*</code> classes in addition to, or in place of, the medium/large ones. Don't worry, the extra-small device grid scales to all resolutions.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You'll still need Respond.js for IE8 (since our media queries are still there and need to be processed).
    This disables the "mobile site" aspects of Bootstrap.</p>

  <h2>Bootstrap template with responsiveness disabled</h2>
  <p>We've applied these steps to an example. Read its source code to see the specific changes implemented.</p>
