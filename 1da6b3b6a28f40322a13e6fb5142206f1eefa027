      "message": "Question Jim, POLICY_LOGS is known here, correct?   can we do \"mkdir -p $POLICY_LOGS\"?   In theory, POLICY_LOGS should be anywhere in the file system.    Typically developer installation won\u0027t install logs directory under /var/log/onap.   It requires priviledge access, and typically this script will run as non-root user, so will fail and exit.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that /var/log is typically root owned.   Some developer scenarions will want to use the \"policy\" owned directory (or non-root directory).   In those scenarios, installation would abort, since not having root privilege, or will create directory unnecessarily.",
