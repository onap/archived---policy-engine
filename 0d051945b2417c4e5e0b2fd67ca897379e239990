      "message": "Not sure about this Mike, the \"scopes\" reference here gets overriden in every iteration with new values.   Note that the method \"addAllScopes\" returns a new set object, and here, it just simply overrides the previous reference losing any values that were accumulated in a previous iteration.   A potential solution would be to pass the Set reference as an additional argument to addAllScopes.",
